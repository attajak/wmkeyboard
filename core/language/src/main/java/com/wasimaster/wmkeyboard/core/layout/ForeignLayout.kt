/**
 * Reading a layout written for a *different* keyboard.
 *
 * Two formats, one parser between them. HeliBoard's JSON layouts are
 * FlorisBoard's: the same `{"$": "text_key", …}` key objects and the same
 * negative key-code numbering, because HeliBoard's parser package is a port of
 * it. HeliBoard's other format is a plain text file, one key per line.
 *
 * **Written from the published formats, not from either project's source.**
 * FlorisBoard is Apache-2.0 and HeliBoard is GPL-3.0; this app is MIT. The key
 * codes below are transcribed from the constants those projects document, which
 * is a fact about a file format, and no upstream code is copied. Test fixtures
 * are hand-written minimal files for the same reason.
 *
 * ### What comes out
 *
 * Only the letters layer. A foreign layout file carries one grid — the symbols
 * and numeric layers belong to the app that read it — and an omitted layer
 * inherits the shipped one (see [LayoutSpec.layers]), which is what a user
 * moving one grid across actually wants.
 *
 * ### Two rules that are not style
 *
 * **A key this app has no action for is dropped, never turned into
 * [KeyAction.Unknown].** That action exists for a layout written by a *newer
 * build of this app*, and its serializer throws on the way back out
 * (`UnknownKeyActionSerializer.serialize`), so a converted layout carrying one
 * would take the whole custom-layouts write down with it when saved. Every drop
 * is reported instead, with the code that caused it.
 *
 * **The result has already been through [LayoutSpec.repair].** The keyboard
 * repairs again on every layout compile and throws the notes away, so anything
 * left for it to fix would be a silent difference between the grid the user
 * approved and the grid they type on. Repairing here, once, keeps the two the
 * same and puts the fixes in front of the user. Repair is idempotent, so the
 * second pass is a no-op.
