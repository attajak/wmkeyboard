/**
 * Rule-based Avro-style phonetic transliteration from romanized Bengali
 * ("banglish") to Bengali script.
 *
 * The engine is a greedy longest-match transliterator over a rule table,
 * with three pieces of context sensitivity:
 *
 *  1. Vowels render as independent letters at a word boundary or after
 *     another vowel, and as vowel signs (kar) after a consonant.
 *  2. Consecutive consonants are joined into conjuncts with a hasant.
 *     The inherent vowel "o" produces no glyph but breaks the cluster,
 *     so "kolokata" stays কলকাতা rather than forming a false conjunct
 *     (whereas "kolkata", with no vowel between l and k, does conjunct).
 *  3. Lowercase "o" is the inherent vowel: silent after a consonant, অ at a
 *     word start or after another vowel. It never writes ো — that is what
 *     the capital "O" is for, exactly as on desktop Avro, so "bhalo" is
 *     ভাল and "bhalO" is ভালো.
 *  4. "rr" spells reph: it renders as a single র that conjuncts with the
 *     following consonant ("dhorrmo" → ধর্ম), except in "rri" (ঋ) or when
 *     no consonant follows.
 *  5. An "a" right after a rendered vowel glides with য় ("kiamot" →
 *     কিয়ামত, "Oasi"/"wasi" → ওয়াসি). Only after the silent
 *     inherent vowel does the independent আ survive ("kuroan" → কুরআন),
 *     and capital "A" is always explicit আ.
 *  6. A backquote breaks the cluster it lands in the middle of, and writes
 *     nothing itself: "kos" conjuncts to ক্স, "k`s" stays কস. It is also how
 *     khanda-ta is spelled — "hoThat`" → হঠাৎ — since a ত with the join taken
 *     off it is exactly what ৎ is.
 *  7. A word-final hasant collapses the ত before it into ৎ, so the same word
 *     comes out of the explicit-hasant spelling too ("hoThat,," → হঠাৎ). Only
 *     ত, and only word-finally: anywhere else a hasant is a live join still
 *     waiting for its next consonant.
 *  8. "Z" is য-ফলা spelled outright — it writes ্য wherever it lands, for the
 *     positions where the "y" rule below would have gone to য় instead.
 *  9. "w" is ব-ফলা after a consonant ("swasthyo" → স্বাস্থ্য) and ও anywhere
 *     else, where the "a" after it glides ("wasi" → ওয়াসি).
 * 10. ং, ঃ and ঁ are signs, not consonants: they hang off the syllable in
 *     front of them and join nothing, so "bangla" is বাংলা and not বাং্লা.
 *     Since only a consonant can start the next syllable, "ng" before a
 *     vowel is ঙ instead — "bangali" → বাঙালি.
 * 11. A capital that spells nothing of its own reads as its lowercase self,
 *     so a stray shift types Bengali rather than dropping a Latin letter
 *     into the middle of a word. The capitals Avro *does* use (T D N S R J,
 *     the long vowels, OI/OU/Ng/NG/Th/Dh/Sh/Rh/TH/HH) are matched first and
 *     never reach that fallback.
 *
 * Dictionary-level corrections (e.g. "asi" → আছি rather than আসি) are the
 * suggestion engine's job, not this transliterator's.
