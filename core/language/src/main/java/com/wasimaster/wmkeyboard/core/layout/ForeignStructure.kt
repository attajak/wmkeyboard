/**
 * A converted grid, given the frame every layout this app ships has.
 *
 * None of the three foreign formats carries that frame. HeliBoard's text format
 * cannot spell a shift, delete, space or enter key at all; FlorisBoard's
 * character grids and HeliBoard's JSON leave all four to the keyboard that reads
 * them; FUTO writes them only when the file moves them, and its bottom row, when
 * it has one, is `?123 , ␣ . ⏎` with no language key. Left to [LayoutSpec.repair]
 * alone, an import came out with no shift key, no ?123 and no 🌐, and a bare
 * `⌫ ␣ ⏎` appended to the end of the last letter row: a grid that typed, and that
 * nobody would keep.
 *
 * So the grid is finished the way the shipped ones are (see
 * `ba_bashkir.wmlayout.json`):
 *
 * - the last letter row is `⇧ … ⌫`, both 1.5 wide;
 * - the bottom row is `?123 , 🌐 ␣ . ⏎`, the spacebar 4 wide.
 *
 * What the file said is kept wherever it said something. A file that placed its
 * own delete key keeps it where it is, and gets no shift key added: FUTO's own
 * rule is that placing either one is how a layout says it wants no automatic
 * pair, so a grid with a delete and no shift asked for no shift. A bottom row the
 * file wrote is read rather than thrown away: its comma and full stop keep their
 * glyphs and their press-and-hold letters (a Bengali `।`, an Urdu `۔`, an Arabic
 * `،`), a key the house row has no slot for keeps its place by the spacebar, and
 * a letter on it moves up to the last letter row so it stays reachable. A
 * functional key the letter rows already have (a PC grid's enter on the home
 * row) is not added a second time.
 *
 * A grid this cannot read safely is handed back untouched, and [LayoutSpec.repair]
 * still guarantees it types: a key spanning rows (moving keys would slide them
 * under it), a spacebar anywhere but the last row, and a last row with more
 * letters on it than a bottom row carries.
