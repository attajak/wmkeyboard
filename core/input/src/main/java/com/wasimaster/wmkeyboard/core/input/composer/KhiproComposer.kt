/**
 * Khipro (issue #400): lowercase keys composed to Bengali by the official
 * Khipro spec ([Khipro]), the whole roman buffer re-read on every key the way
 * KhiproTeam's own library does it.
 *
 * Unlike Avro there is no reading to guess. The keys spell exactly one word,
 * so the commit is [composeBuffer] as it stands and the dictionary only
 * finishes words ([completionLanguage]), never corrects them.
 *
 * Khipro's modifiers are punctuation keys, so this composer takes more than
 * letters into its buffer: `/` (the slicer, and ঁ after a vowel), `;` (the
 * separator: `budh;bar` is বুধবার), `?` and `\` (the blinder, whose run stays
 * Latin), the danda (`।f` is ॥ and `।ff` is ৺, issue #488) and, inside a
 * word, `,` (`,,` is the nukta).
 *
 * Two specs ship. A phone keyboard already has keys for Bengali digits and the
 * danda, so soft keys read against the touchscreen spec, which leaves those
 * alone. A hardware keyboard has only ASCII, so a word typed on one reads
 * against the desktop spec, where `1` is ১, `.` is । and `$` is ৳. [variant]
 * is chosen when a word starts and kept until it is committed, so one word is
 * never read half one way and half the other.
