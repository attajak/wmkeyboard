 * buffer and [composeBuffer] folds them into fully-toned Vietnamese, shown as
 * the composing region and committed as a unit — the same shape as Avro/Hangul,
 * so no dictionary and no candidate list are involved.
 *
 * Telex spells the diacritics with letters (`as`→á, `aa`→â, `aw`→ă, `ow`→ơ,
 * `w`→ư, `dd`→đ, tones s/f/r/x/j) and takes a tone back off with `z` (`toansz`
 * → `toan`); VNI spells them with digits (1..5 tones, 6 circumflex, 7 horn,
 * 8 breve, 9 đ, 0 clears the tone). The engine is shared; only the
 * keystroke→intent mapping differs.
 *
 * The tone lands on the syllable's main vowel by the standard rule: a vowel that
 * already carries a mark (â ê ô ă ơ ư) wins; otherwise a single vowel takes it,
 * a closed cluster puts it on the last vowel, and an open cluster on the first
 * (except oa/oe/uy, which take the second). `qu`/`gi` onsets are not counted as
 * the nucleus.
