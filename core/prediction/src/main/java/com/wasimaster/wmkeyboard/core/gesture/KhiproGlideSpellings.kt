/**
 * The Khipro spellings of a Bangla word list, worked out on the device and
 * kept on disk, so a swipe over the Khipro grid can be read as any word of the
 * list (#541): the bundled one, a downloaded one, an imported one, all of it.
 *
 * Every word goes through [KhiproRomanizer], which runs Khipro's own rules
 * backwards and keeps a spelling only if Khipro turns it back into the word.
 * That is a few hundred microseconds a word, minutes for a 450,000-word list
 * on a phone, so it is done once, on every core, and written as a `.wmdict`
 * that is mapped rather than read; it is redone only when the list changes.
 *
 * The data repo publishes those spellings for its own list
 * (`bn_khipro_glide.txt.gz`, see `KhiproGlideDownloads`), worked out once on a
 * computer, and a list built with that file at hand reads its words' spellings
 * from it: only the words it does not list (the bundled list's extras, an
 * import) are spelled on the device, which is seconds rather than minutes of
 * every core (#593).
 *
 * The slicer `/` counts as a key a stroke passes through, so words with
 * চন্দ্রবিন্দু and খণ্ড-ত are spelled too; a word that needs any other
 * non-letter key has no spelling and is typed.
