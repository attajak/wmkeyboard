/**
 * Which stretch of history a statistics view covers.
 */
enum class StatsPeriod { DAY, WEEK, MONTH }

/**
 * Running totals of the user's typing: characters, words, backspaces and
 * active time, kept per local calendar day plus lifetime sums.
 *
 * Only aggregate counts are ever stored — no text, no per-app split, no
 * timestamps finer than the day bucket and a lifetime hour-of-day histogram.
 * That is the whole privacy story of the Statistics screen, so nothing may be
 * added here that would let a reader of the file reconstruct what was typed
 * or where. The tap heatmap (issue #390) keeps to it: a lifetime count per
 * quarter-key cell of each layout, with no order and no time, so it says
 * which parts of the board get hit and never which letters followed which.
 *
 * Beside the typing itself sit the lifetime tallies the levels and
 * achievements are built from (issue #390): words the strip predicted or
 * finished, keystrokes that saved, glided words and how far the finger
 * travelled drawing them. See [TypingProgress].
 *
 * What counts as typing is a keystroke that reaches the user's text field:
 * soft keys, hardware keys, braille and morse all funnel through the same
 * per-character path, and words picked from the suggestion strip or drawn by
 * a glide count as words. Voice, handwriting and panel inserts (emoji,
 * clipboard, translate) are insertions rather than typing and are left out on
 * purpose — they would also make the speed figures meaningless.
 *
 * Speed has no prompt to score against (unlike [scoreTypingTest]), so active
 * time is measured burst-wise: the gap between two keystrokes joins
 * `activeMs` only when it is at most [BURST_GAP_MS]. Words per minute is then
 * the usual chars/5 over that active time. Pauses — thinking, switching
 * apps, or recording being disabled — add neither characters nor active
 * time, so they can never dilute the average.
 *
 * Words are counted by a boundary detector on the keystroke stream itself
 * (a letter or digit arms `pendingWord`; a separator or flush counts it),
 * which works identically for composing and direct-commit scripts without a
 * hook in the word-commit path. [onWordsCommitted] clears the armed flag so
 * a half-typed word completed by a suggestion pick is counted exactly once.
 *
 * Storage follows the personal-store contract: nullable file (direct boot →
 * memory only), dirty-flag save on dismissal, [reload] for external edits by
 * the settings app. Lives in `stats/`, not `learning/` — "Delete learned
 * words" must not take the statistics with it.
