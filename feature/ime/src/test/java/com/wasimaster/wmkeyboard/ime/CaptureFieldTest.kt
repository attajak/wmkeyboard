/**
 * The keyboard's own text fields have a caret, and one ladder decides which of
 * them has the keys (issue #161).
 *
 * Plain JVM tests, no Robolectric: [CaretText] is arithmetic and
 * [KeyboardUiState.captureTarget] is a `when`, and both are worth pinning
 * because everything else in #161 is built on them — a glide inserts at the
 * caret, a suggestion replaces the word around it, and a keystroke that picked
 * the wrong target types into the app behind the keyboard.
