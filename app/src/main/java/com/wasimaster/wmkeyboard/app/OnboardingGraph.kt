 *
 * The emoji page is one of those the depth answer earns. Both halves of it —
 * the default skin tone and the emoji-font repair — are appearance questions
 * about a panel the short path hasn't opened yet, and both are asked again
 * under Languages & emoji; the tone in particular is only worth a wizard page
 * to someone who came here to tune things. On a replay the welcome page only
 * appears when the keyboard actually needs setting up again.
 *
 * The app-language page comes before everything, welcome included, because
 * every page after it is words: someone who reads Bengali first should read
 * the rest of the wizard in Bengali. [askAppLanguage] is decided by the phone's
 * region (see [shouldAskAppLanguage]), so it never shows where English is the
 * first language, and never on a build that has only English to offer.
