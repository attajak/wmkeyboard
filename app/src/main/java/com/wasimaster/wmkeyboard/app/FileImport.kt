/**
 * Opening one of the keyboard's own files from outside the app — a file
 * manager, a chat app's "open with", a downloads notification.
 *
 * Every format the keyboard exports is either JSON or a ZIP, so the manifest
 * filters on the *file name* first (`pathPattern` per extension), which is why
 * each export writes a compound extension: `.wmtheme.json` rather than
 * `.json`. A name is the precise signal, and it is what keeps a file of ours
 * out of the chooser's crowd of unknown binaries.
 *
 * A name is not always there, though. A provider may hand out a URI with no
 * file name in it at all — the downloads provider answers `msf:19` for
 * anything MediaStore has indexed — and every pattern misses those, which used
 * to mean a theme downloaded in a browser opened in some other keyboard and
 * never in this one. So the manifest also claims `application/json` and
 * `application/octet-stream` outright, and this app is now offered for files
 * that are nobody's business here. [Opened.Text] is the other half of that
 * bargain: anything readable that turns out not to be ours opens in the editor
 * rather than on an error.
 *
 * The extension only gets the file here. What is actually *done* with it is
 * decided by reading it: every format but the theme carries a format tag, so
 * a `.wmlayout.json` holding a backup still restores a backup.
